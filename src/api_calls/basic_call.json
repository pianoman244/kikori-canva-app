        "description": "A communication and connection activity that allows participants to exchange appreciations with each other.",
        "preparation": "<p>This activity can be used as part of a Morning Meeting. A space where students can safely move is important.&nbsp; If you are indoors, you may request that students can walk fast as their fastest speed.</p><p> Greetings should begin with students in a circle where all are sitting and can see each other.  While students are standing in a circle, you should provide students with the directions for the activity.</p><p>Morning Meeting always begins with Greeting. In Greeting, each child is welcomed by name and practices welcoming others.&nbsp; The purpose of the Morning Meeting Greeting is to let our students know that we see them, we hear them, and that they belong to something important.                            </p><p>The goals of the Greeting component are:</p><ol><li>To set a positive tone for the day</li><li>To provide a sense of recognition and belonging</li><li>To help children learn and use everyoneâ€™s name</li><li>To let children practice hospitality                        </li></ol><p>In Greeting, children not only learn and practice the basic elements of greeting each other in a friendly way, they also gain experience in reaching across gender, clique, and friendship lines.</p>",
        "playing": "<p><b>Steps:</b></p><ol><li>Say: \" We are going to take a moment to show appreciation or thank our friends/classmates for things they do.\" </li><li>Model this with one or two students. An example could be, \"Sadie, thank you for being a great clean up monitor and helping to keep our classroom clean for everyone\" or \" Ellis, I appreciate how you always are willing to share during center time.\" </li><li>Ask two students to model this to each other,&nbsp; ensuring they use their friend's name and the sentence starter&nbsp; of \" (Name), Thank you for&nbsp; ...\" or&nbsp; \"(Name) I appreciate how you/that you...\"</li><li>Ask the whole group to think about and share out some appreciations they have for others in their group.&nbsp;</li><li>Say: \"When I say go, walk to someone in your group/in the room and share a thank you/appreciation.&nbsp; Keep going until I say stop.\"&nbsp;</li><li>Say: \"When I say stop, share a thank you to the person closest to your body.\"</li><li>This continues until everyone has appreciated everyone else in the group or until the allotted time is up.</li></ol>",
        "learning": "<p>Appreciation Mingle is designed for students to connect at the beginning of a class, mid-day, or end of day reflection. If you are interested in reflecting with students on the value of an Appreciation Mingle, please see sample reflection questions below.</p><p><b>Reflect: (What?)</b><br></p><ul><li>What did you like about Appreciation Greetings?&nbsp;</li><li>How did it feel to give appreciation or thank someone in your class/group?</li><li>How did it feel to receive appreciation or have someone thank you?&nbsp;</li></ul><b>Connect: (So what?)</b><br><ul><li>When are times you can share an appreciation greeting?&nbsp;</li><li>Who are some other people in our lives we can give an appreciation greeting to? &nbsp;(ex. family, teachers, weekend enrichment providers, babysitters)</li></ul><b>Grow: (Now what?)</b><br><ul><li>How can we use appreciation greetings in our everyday life? (ex. community workers, grocery store workers, school community members, security guards)</li></ul><p></p>",
        "variation": "<p>If your group is practicing social distancing, you can add in the rule that students still need to complete the actions of the handshake, yet be a certain distance apart from each other.  You can ask students afterwards what elements they did that made this a greeting, EVEN THOUGH they weren't able to touch!</p>",
